# 🧠 Discord + Google Apps Script Automations

This repository contains a collection of **Google Apps Script** tools that integrate with **Discord Webhooks** and **Google Sheets** — built to power fun community features like daily questions, raffles, Bible prompts, and member engagement systems.

All scripts use the same core design:
- **Google Sheets** as a data store
- **Apps Script triggers** for scheduling
- **Discord Webhooks** for posting
- Lightweight, serverless architecture (no bot hosting required)

## 🛠️ Shared Utilities

Each script follows the same code pattern for webhooks:
```js
function postToDiscord(payload) {
  const options = {
    method: 'post',
    contentType: 'application/json',
    payload: JSON.stringify(payload),
    muteHttpExceptions: true
  };
  UrlFetchApp.fetch(WEBHOOK_URL, options);
}
